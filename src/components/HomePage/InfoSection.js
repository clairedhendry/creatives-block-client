           As creatives, we get stuck from time to time. It’s normal!
            <br/>
            Creative's Block is here to help! 
            <br/>
            Post a work in progress, and get feedback from our community of creatives.
            <br/>
            Choose a category: Art, Writing, or Music.
            <br/>
            Then share it! 
            <br/>
            Check back often to see feedback on your block.
            <br/>
            Update, edit, or delete your block whenever you want!
            <br/>
            Giving feedback earns you block credits
            <br/>
            Spend your block credits to post more blocks of your own
